# Dynamic-Price-Prediction-for-Air-Transportation-System-

Nowadays, the number of people using flights has increased significantly. It is difficult for airlines to maintain prices since prices change dynamically due to different conditions. In this project, we aim to use Dynamic Pricing for predicting the fare of the airlines based on Market Conditions and other socio-economic factors that might affect the prices. We plan on comparing multiple models to review best accuracy.

First, we will scrape the flight details data from Kayak and later we will be analyzing the flight fare using essential exploratory data analysis techniques and will draw some predictions about the price of the flight based on some features such as what type of airline it is, what is the arrival time, what is the departure time, what is the duration of the flight, source, destination and more.
